# Magento Utils plugin for Sublime Text 2

Currently only provides one functionality:

* When right clicking on a file or directory inside the base or default packages from magento, it will show a menu item to copy that file or directory into your custom package.
* Also does the same for code/core and code/community => code/local directories
